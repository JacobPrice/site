I’m still baffled that it is the end of the year, but life goes fast when you
are ~~busy~~ having fun. I like to start my new year's resolutions in December
to give me the best odds of succeeding throughout the next year. So here we are
on Day 0 of one of my new year's resolution. This will probably be an ongoing
list that I update periodically should I have something else to add or I
accomplish a goal. Some goals I won’t add as they are more mindful and not
particularly quantifiable.

## 2018 Goals

* [ ] Write something everyday for 100 days
* [ ] Acquire a rental property
* [ ] Lose 20lbs
* [ ] Squat 425lbs
* [ ] 28 minute 4 mile run
